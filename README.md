# Neural Networks from Scratch
Implementing Artificial Neural Network from scratch using C++

There are two implementations listed here:
1) A [basic_ann](https://github.com/codebuddha/Neural_Networks_from_Scratch/blob/master/basic_ann.cpp) without using any libraries, just raw C++
2) A vectorized implementation of an ANN using the [ArrayFire](http://arrayfire.org/docs/index.htm) library that allows the use of an unified source-code to compile programs for CPU, CUDA, as well as OpenCL
